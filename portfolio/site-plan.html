      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        (I dont have every single project written up for yet but this is the structure)
        Project: Disease_Spread_sim_1.0
        Project Description: 
        The Disease Spread Simulator 1.0 is a simulation program that models the spread of a disease within a population. 
        The program uses a graphical interface to display the simulation, allowing users to visualize how different parameters affect the spread of the disease.

        Video [Embedded demonstration Video] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbj1ugUJgo [video will probably change in the future as I figure out how the projects page will look]
        Goal of the project:
        The goal of this project is to create a visual simulation of disease spread within a defined population.
        Users can set various parameters such as death rate, spread rate, and population size to observe how these factors influence the progression of the disease. 
        The simulation provides insights into how different scenarios can impact the overall health of the population.
        I wanted to learn how to create GUIs, and learn how to detect colisions between objects.
        Technologies used:
        Python: The simulation is implemented in Python programming language.
        kinter: The graphical user interface is created using the Tkinter library.
        Math Library: Mathematical calculations and formulas are performed using the math library.
        Random Library: Random numbers are generated using the random library.
